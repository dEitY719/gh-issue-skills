# gh-issue:create — Step 4 Create Command

Detail companion to SKILL.md Step 4. Writes the drafted body to a temp
file, appends the ai-metrics footer (unless `GH_DISABLE_AI_METRICS=1`),
and calls either `gh issue create` (default) or the
`_gh_discussion_*` helpers (`DISCUSSION_MODE=1`, dEitY719/dotfiles#619).

`$TOKENS`, `$HUMAN_H`, `$ELAPSED` come from Step 3.5.
`LABEL_ARGS` / `MILESTONE_ARGS` are the arrays Step 2.5 prepared (one
`--label <name>` per kept label; `--milestone <title>` if resolved).
Both are empty when Step 2.5 was skipped — the `gh issue create`
invocation degrades to its original form. When `DISCUSSION_MODE=1`,
Step 2.5 is skipped unconditionally, so both arrays are empty and the
Discussion branch ignores them.

## Issue path (default)

```bash
BODY=$(mktemp) && trap 'rm -f "$BODY"' EXIT
# ... write body to "$BODY" ...
# The footer's bytes are single-sourced in lib/ai-metrics-footer.sh, which
# also honours GH_DISABLE_AI_METRICS=1 itself — no guard needed here. The `||`
# is metrics-helper.md's soft-fail rule: never block the create on the footer.
bash "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT:-.}/lib/ai-metrics-footer.sh" \
    "$TOKENS" "$HUMAN_H" "$ELAPSED" >> "$BODY" \
    || echo "[WARN] ai-metrics append failed — continuing." >&2
GH_HOST="$TARGET_HOST" gh issue create --repo "$TARGET_REPO" \
    --title "<title>" --body-file "$BODY" \
    "${LABEL_ARGS[@]}" "${MILESTONE_ARGS[@]}"
```

`GH_HOST` 와 `--repo` 는 둘 다 필수이며 Step 1 이 같은 remote URL 에서 뽑은
쌍이다 (`references/repo-resolution.md`). 하나라도 빠지면 gh CLI 가 자기
`gh repo set-default` 를 따라가 dual-host 로그인에서 다른 서버에 이슈를
만들어 버린다 — 사람이 지워야 되돌아온다 (dEitY719/dotfiles#1403).

`--assignee` is still only added when the user asks. User-supplied
`--label` flags survive Step 2.5 (union with auto labels) unless
`--no-auto-labels` was set, in which case Step 2.5 is bypassed and the
user's labels pass straight through `LABEL_ARGS` from Step 1.

## Discussion path (`DISCUSSION_MODE=1`)

Triggered by `--as-discussion <category>` from Step 1.1. Sources the
shared helper used by [[gh-issue:discussion-create]] and calls the three
GraphQL primitives in order. `$CATEGORY` was validated in Step 1.1
against `Ideas` / `Q&A` / `Announcements` / `Lessons` — no extra
validation here.

```bash
# Fail fast if the helper file is missing (skill installed but
# helper not yet symlinked into shell-common/).
_GD="${DOTFILES_ROOT:-$HOME/dotfiles}/shell-common/functions/gh_discussion.sh" # tier 1
# No tier 4 (dEitY719/harness-skills#22): $PWD is caller-controlled here.
[ -f "$_GD" ] || [ -z "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT:-}" ] \
    || _GD="$CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT/lib/vendor/shell-common/functions/gh_discussion.sh" # tier 2
if [ ! -f "$_GD" ] || [ ! -r "$_GD" ]; then
    printf '[FAIL] gh-discussion helper not found at %s\n' "$_GD" >&2
    printf 'Next: install gh-discussion-create skill first; on any harness other than Claude Code, export CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT=<plugin dir> before pasting this block.\n' >&2
    return 1 2>/dev/null || exit 1
fi
# shellcheck disable=SC1091
. "$_GD"

BODY=$(mktemp) && trap 'rm -f "$BODY"' EXIT
# GH_HOST was exported in Step 1; the _gh_discussion_* GraphQL helpers
# below read it from the environment, so the Discussion lands on the same
# host as the Issue path would have (dEitY719/dotfiles#1403).
# ... write Open-Questions-forward body to "$BODY" (Step 3 sets shape) ...
# The footer's bytes are single-sourced in lib/ai-metrics-footer.sh, which
# also honours GH_DISABLE_AI_METRICS=1 itself — no guard needed here. The `||`
# is metrics-helper.md's soft-fail rule: never block the create on the footer.
bash "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT:-.}/lib/ai-metrics-footer.sh" \
    "$TOKENS" "$HUMAN_H" "$ELAPSED" gh-issue-create >> "$BODY" \
    || echo "[WARN] ai-metrics append failed — continuing." >&2

_owner="${TARGET_REPO%%/*}"
_repo="${TARGET_REPO##*/}"

REPO_ID=$(_gh_discussion_repo_id "$_owner" "$_repo") || exit 1
CATEGORY_ID=$(_gh_discussion_category_id "$_owner" "$_repo" "$CATEGORY") || exit 1
URL=$(_gh_discussion_create "$REPO_ID" "$CATEGORY_ID" "$TITLE" "$BODY") || exit 1

printf '[OK] Discussion (%s): %s\n' "$CATEGORY" "$URL"
```

The three helper calls match [[gh-issue:discussion-create]]'s
`references/create-cmd.md` byte-for-byte — keep them in lock-step. If
the helper ever changes signature, update both skills together.

확인 질문하지 말고 즉시 실행.

The footer's emoji glyphs live in `lib/ai-metrics-footer.sh` alone; this file
quotes none of them. `CLAUDE.md`'s ai-metrics exception covers that script and
nothing else in this skill.
