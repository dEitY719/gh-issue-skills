# gh-issue:create — Dependency Auto-detect (Step 2.6 + Step 4.5)

Detail companion to SKILL.md Step 2.6 (detect) and Step 4.5 (link).
The skill scans the conversation for an explicit *선행 이슈* statement and,
after the new issue exists, wires it up with GitHub's **native Issue
Dependencies** (`addBlockedBy`) so the web UI shows `Blocked by #N` in the
sidebar and the state can never drift from the referenced issue's real state.

Native dependencies were chosen over a `blocked-by-13` label (nobody owns
removing it when `#13` closes) and over making the `Depends on #13` body line
this repo already uses the *only* channel — a plain-text trailer cannot be
queried the way GitHub's own dependency graph can. Both alternatives and their
rejection reasons are recorded in issue #1424.

The trailer is not hypothetical here, so the two channels now coexist:
`references/templates/feat.md` still tells Step 3 to write `Depends on #N`
under `## Dependencies`, and [[gh-issue:implement]] (`references/claim.md`
Step 3.5) and [[gh-issue:proceed]] (`references/claim.md` Step 2.1.5) both
grep issue bodies for that exact line. Those two guards read the body only —
a native link created here is invisible to them, and a trailer written by
Step 3 is not linked natively. Reconciling the two is out of v1 scope.

`Issue.blockedBy` / `Issue.blocking` and the `addBlockedBy` /
`removeBlockedBy` mutations are available on `github.com` and on GHES 3.19+,
so the step works on either host without a capability probe.

`addBlockedBy` takes **one** blocker per call: `AddBlockedByInput` is
`{issueId: ID!, blockingIssueId: ID!}`, verified against the live schema.
The shape is recorded here, not just the availability, because a wrong
argument name is not loud: NF-1 downgrades the rejection to one warning
line and the issue is still created (#1445). Since #1457 that record is
enforced rather than merely written down — see "Test fixture" below.
That warning now also carries the server's own sentence as its `원인:` line
(#1458), so the next such mismatch identifies itself instead of looking like
a network blip.

## Step 2.6 — Detection (F-1)

Skip entirely when `--no-auto-deps` **or** `DISCUSSION_MODE=1` is set —
Discussions have no dependency graph. `--no-auto-deps` skips detection *and*
therefore Step 4.5, mirroring how `--no-auto-labels` short-circuits Step 2.5.

These phrases mark a dependency. Korean forms trail the reference, English
forms lead it, and matching is case-insensitive:

| Trigger | Example |
|---|---|
| `#N (완료\|해결)(후\|뒤\|되면\|하고\|하면)` | `#13 완료 후에 진행`, `#13 완료되면`, `#13 해결 후` |
| `#N 이후` | `#13 이후에 재확인` |
| `선행 이슈 #N` | `선행 이슈: #13`, `선행이슈 #13` (colon optional, full-width `：` also matches) |
| `depends on #N` | `This depends on #13` |
| `blocked by #N` | `blocked by #13` |

The 완료/해결 row enumerates conjugations rather than matching a loose
`#N .* 후`: the reference and the trigger word must stay adjacent, or
`#13 참고. 검토 후 진행` would link `#13` to an unrelated clause.

A plain mention is **not** a trigger — `#13 참고`, `#13 관련`, and a bare
`#13` all yield nothing. That asymmetry is the whole point: an auto-linked
false positive is worse than a missed link, because it silently blocks the
new issue in the dispatcher's view.

The reference regex keeps the `owner/repo` prefix optional:

```
([A-Za-z0-9._-]+/[A-Za-z0-9._-]+)?#[0-9]+
```

so a cross-repo reference is *recognised* and then rejected (NF-2) rather
than being mistaken for the same-numbered issue in `$TARGET_REPO`:

```
dependency-detect: cross-repo dependency detected but not supported in v1 — skip (owner/repo#13)
```

Stash the surviving numbers (ascending, de-duped) as `DEP_NUMS` for Step 4.5.
Detection touches no GitHub state — its only outputs are `DEP_NUMS` and the
NF-2 stderr line above — so it is safe to run before the issue exists.

Detection ends in `grep`, which exits 1 when the conversation names no
dependency at all. That is the common case, so the pipeline must absorb it:
under a caller's `set -e` + `set -o pipefail` an unguarded exit 1 would abort
the whole issue creation over "nothing to link".

## Step 4.5 — Linking (F-2)

The new issue's number only exists after Step 4, which is why the mutation
runs here rather than inside Step 2.6. For each `N` in `DEP_NUMS`, resolve
both node ids in one round trip (aliases), then mutate:

```bash
DEP_WARNINGS=""
# A failed mktemp must not turn the cause capture into a redirection
# error on an empty variable — fall back to a PID-scoped path. No EXIT
# trap: Step 4.5 never aborts (NF-1), so the rm below is always reached,
# and a trap here would silently replace the one create-cmd.md installs
# for its own $BODY when both blocks run in the same shell.
_errf=$(mktemp) || _errf="${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/gh-issue-create-dep-$$.err"
for N in $DEP_NUMS; do
    # `// ""` on both ids is what keeps a GraphQL null out of the mutation:
    # a missing issue resolves to null, and interpolating that would send the
    # literal string "null" as an ID!.
    # stderr lands in $_errf rather than /dev/null (#1458): a non-existent
    # number is rejected *here*, not by the mutation, and the rejection names
    # itself in plain text. stdout stays on the pipe because $IDS needs it —
    # which is why this is a file and not a `2>&1` merge.
    # Variables: $owner String!, $name String!, $new Int!, $dep Int!
    IDS=$(GH_HOST="$TARGET_HOST" gh api graphql \
        -f owner="${TARGET_REPO%%/*}" -f name="${TARGET_REPO##*/}" \
        -F new="$NEW_NUM" -F dep="$N" \
        -f query='
          query($owner:String!, $name:String!, $new:Int!, $dep:Int!) {
            repository(owner:$owner, name:$name) {
              newIssue: issue(number:$new) { id }
              depIssue: issue(number:$dep) { id }
            }
          }' --jq '(.data.repository // {}) |
                   "\(.newIssue.id // "") \(.depIssue.id // "")"' 2>"$_errf") || IDS=""

    _new_id="${IDS%% *}"
    _dep_id="${IDS##* }"
    _rc=1
    if [ -n "$_new_id" ] && [ -n "$_dep_id" ]; then
        # $_errf is reused, so a clean lookup can never leave a stale cause
        # attached to a mutation failure — the redirect truncates it.
        # Variables: $issueId ID!, $blockingIssueId ID!
        GH_HOST="$TARGET_HOST" gh api graphql \
            -f issueId="$_new_id" -f blockingIssueId="$_dep_id" \
            -f query='
              mutation($issueId:ID!, $blockingIssueId:ID!) {
                addBlockedBy(input:{issueId:$issueId, blockingIssueId:$blockingIssueId}) {
                  issue { number }
                }
              }' >/dev/null 2>"$_errf" && _rc=0
    fi

    # NF-1: one warning per failed N, on stderr *and* stacked for Step 5.
    # Emitting only to stderr would lose it — Step 5's report is the artifact
    # the operator actually reads.
    if [ "$_rc" -ne 0 ]; then
        _w="[WARN] Blocked by #${N} 링크 실패 — GH UI에서 수동 추가 필요"
        _cause=$(head -n 1 "$_errf")
        if [ -n "$_cause" ]; then
            _w="${_w}
    원인: ${_cause}"
        fi
        printf '%s\n' "$_w" >&2
        DEP_WARNINGS="${DEP_WARNINGS}${_w}
"
    fi
done
rm -f "$_errf"
```

`$DEP_WARNINGS` is what Step 5 prepends to its verdict line
(`references/report-template.md`). An empty value means every `N` linked.

Aliasing both lookups into one query keeps this at 2 round trips per `N`,
and the mutation half cannot go lower: `AddBlockedByInput` takes a single
`blockingIssueId: ID!`, so blockers are linked one at a time. NF-1's
per-`N` warning line falls out of that for free — one bad number can never
reject its siblings.

`GH_HOST` is mandatory here for the same reason it is on every other `gh`
call in this skill (#1403): the GraphQL endpoint is chosen by host, and a
dual-host login otherwise resolves node ids on the wrong server — where the
query succeeds and returns ids for a stranger's issues.

## Failure handling (NF-1)

The issue already exists by the time Step 4.5 runs, so nothing here is
allowed to abort. Any failure — missing permission, network error, a
`DEP_NUMS` entry that does not exist, a null node id, a rejected mutation,
or a host whose schema has no `addBlockedBy` at all — takes the same path:
one stderr line, one line stacked into `$DEP_WARNINGS` for the Step 5 report.

```
[WARN] Blocked by #<N> 링크 실패 — GH UI에서 수동 추가 필요
    원인: <captured stderr, first line>
```

The `원인:` line is what separates those causes from one another (#1458).
"Does not abort" and "throws the diagnosis away" are independent decisions,
and Step 4.5 used to take both: `>/dev/null 2>&1` on the calls meant a
permanent defect and a transient blip printed the same sentence. #1445 was a
100%-reproducible argument-schema mismatch, and the server named it —
`Argument 'blockingIssueId' on InputObject 'AddBlockedByInput' is required` —
into a discarded stream. A failure diagnoses itself only at the moment it
happens; after the issue exists the same conditions cannot be reconstructed.

The line is omitted entirely when nothing was captured, so a silent failure
still produces exactly the one line it always did. Only the first line of the
capture is carried: the full GraphQL error would swamp `$DEP_WARNINGS` in the
Step 5 report, and the first line already tells schema, permission, and
network apart.

Never retry, never fall back to a label or a body trailer: a half-applied
dependency the operator cannot see is worse than a visible warning. Making
the cause visible is not a step toward automatic recovery — a retry would
still delay the report on the replication-lag path for something the operator
resolves in two clicks.

That one path is also why the availability claim above needs no capability
probe. If a target's schema turns out not to expose `addBlockedBy`, the
mutation is rejected and the operator gets the warning — the same outcome a
probe would produce, minus a round trip on every run.

Known non-error cause of that warning: GitHub's own replication lag. The new
issue is seconds old when its node id is queried, and a read can miss it.
The result is a warning, not a wrong link, and the fix stays manual — and its
`원인:` line is what lets the operator tell it apart from a defect at a glance.

## Out of v1 scope

- Adding or removing a dependency on an **existing** issue — a separate
  command, tracked separately.
- Cross-repo (`owner/repo#N`) dependencies — detected, warned, skipped.
- The consumer side (a dispatcher gating on `blockedBy`) — different repo.

## Test fixture

Detection **and** the Step 4.5 outcome classification are mirrored in
`tests/bats/skills/_fixtures/gh_issue_create_dependency_detect.sh`, locked by
`tests/bats/skills/gh_issue_create_dependency_detect.bats`. That fixture's
header carries the sync rule for trigger-phrase changes.

What the suite covers: the trigger matrix, the plain-mention negatives, the
NF-2 cross-repo skip, `--no-auto-deps`, every id/mutation state that produces
(or suppresses) the NF-1 warning, and the `원인:` line's presence, truncation,
and absence-when-silent. Two drift guards hold the doc to the fixture: the
reference regex printed here must be byte-identical to the fixture's, and this
doc must not reintroduce `>/dev/null 2>&1` over the GraphQL calls. Editing one
side without the other turns the suite red.

Since #1457 it also pins the `addBlockedBy` argument shape, two ways:

- **Offline** — string assertions that the prose shape line and the mutation
  above both still name `blockingIssueId`, plus a negative one that the
  rejected `blockedByIds` array spelling from #1445 survives in none of this
  file's **fenced code blocks**. The negative half is scoped to fenced code
  on purpose (PR #1465 review): a whole-file ban would also forbid this
  paragraph from naming the old spelling at all, and the history is worth
  writing down. Coverage does not narrow — the two positive assertions
  already pin both places the name appears.
- **Live schema** — `AddBlockedByInput`'s input fields are read back from
  the real API by introspection and compared against the shape recorded at
  the top of this file. This is not a mock; it is a read-only query against
  the server whose shape this doc records. Without network or `gh` auth it
  **skips** rather than fails, so an offline shell never goes red over an
  unrelated concern.

That skip raises a fair question — who ever runs the networked half? The
answer is `git/hooks/pre-push`, which runs `mise run test` on every push;
this repo has no CI test lane by design (#754 moved the suite to that hook,
SSOT in `docs/.ssot/local-test-policy.md`). The pushing machine is the one
that just authenticated `gh`, so the guard fires on the path that matters.
It is a developer-machine guarantee rather than a server-side one — a push
with `SKIP_LOCAL_PYTEST=1`, or from a shell without `gh` auth, skips it, and
the offline half is what covers that case.

The two fail on different things on purpose: the offline check catches an
accidental edit here, the live one catches an upstream schema change.

What it still does not cover: the two GraphQL invocations themselves —
mocking `gh` would test the mock. Everything that decides what happens
*around* them is fixtured, which is where the branching lives. Scope of the
shape guards is `addBlockedBy` alone; the `Issue.blockedBy` read path was
confirmed working in #1445, and pinning the whole schema would cost more
upkeep than it returns.
