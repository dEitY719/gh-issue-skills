# gh-issue:discussion-convert — Step 5-8 Convert Command

Detail companion to SKILL.md Steps 5 through 8. Reads the JSON
captured in Step 2 (the `_gh_discussion_fetch` output) and runs the
emulated convert sequence in order.

Inputs bound by the caller:

- `$TARGET_REPO`        — `owner/repo` from Step 1
- `$TARGET_HOST`        — the host parsed from that same remote URL
                          (Step 1); also exported as `GH_HOST`
- `$N`                  — Discussion number (positional arg)
- `$DISC_JSON`          — path to the temp file holding the JSON from
                          `_gh_discussion_fetch`
- `$OPT_NO_COMMENT`     — `1` if `--no-comment` was passed
- `$OPT_NO_LOCK`        — `1` if `--no-lock` was passed
- `$OPT_NO_CLOSE`       — `1` if `--no-close` was passed
- `$OPT_NO_BOARD_SYNC`  — `1` if `--no-board-sync` was passed

# Step 3 — category guard (done by caller; this file assumes pass).

# Step 4 — idempotency check.

# non-empty, breaking first-run conversion (PR #628 gemini review).

    # exported GH_HOST from Step 1 (#1403 / #1407) -- --repo names a
    # repo but no server.
    _gh_project_status_sync issue "$ISSUE_NUMBER" "In progress" \

## Why four primitive mutations instead of one

`Convert to issue` lives only in the GitHub UI as of 2026-05. There
is no documented REST endpoint and the GraphQL schema does not expose
a `convertDiscussion` mutation. Until GitHub ships one, the
combination of `createIssue` + `addDiscussionComment` +
`closeDiscussion` + `lockLockable` reproduces every observable
side-effect of the native convert flow except the "transferred to
issue" UI banner. The lost banner is acceptable; the policy
invariants it visualises (close + bidirectional backlink + lock) are
still mechanically enforced here.

## Why `gh issue create` instead of GraphQL `createIssue`

The Issue mutation needs `repositoryId` (a node ID), default labels,
default assignee, and milestone handling — all of which `gh issue
create` resolves from `owner/repo` automatically and prints a stable
URL we can scrape for the issue number. A raw `createIssue` GraphQL
call would force this skill to re-implement that resolution chain,
duplicating logic that already lives in `gh-issue:create` /
`gh-issue:implement`.

## Why best-effort on Steps 6 / 7 / 8

The SSOT invariant is "decided Discussion -> tracked Issue with
backlink". Step 5 alone satisfies that contract. Steps 6 / 7 / 8 are
ergonomic helpers (board hygiene, reverse backlink, locked forum).
Rolling back the new Issue when one of them flakes would leave the
user in a worse state — Discussion still open, no Issue, work lost.
We warn and keep going.

## Idempotency mechanics

Step 4's `gh issue list --search "in:body ..."` relies on GitHub's
search indexer, which lags writes by a few seconds. The race window
where two near-simultaneous `gh-issue:discussion-convert` invocations could
both miss the index and create duplicate Issues is real but tiny;
human review at the Issue list is the last defense. We do not block
the skill on a sleep-and-recheck because the realistic call pattern
is one human running the skill once.
