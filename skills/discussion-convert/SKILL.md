# gh-issue:discussion-convert — Decided Ideas Discussion -> Issue

## Help

If arg #1 is `-h`, `--help`, or `help`, read `references/help.md` and
output its content verbatim, then stop. No API calls.

## Role

Automate the 4-step `Discussion -> Issue` 변환 규약 from
`dEitY719/dotfiles/docs/.ssot/discussions-policy.md` (dEitY719/dotfiles#612). GitHub exposes no public
`convertDiscussion` mutation, so this skill emulates the UI `Convert to issue`
path via four primitive mutations — Issue carrying an `Originated from discussion
#<N>` backlink, a `Linked to issue #<M>` comment back on the Discussion, close
(reason Resolved) + lock — plus a board sync to `In progress`, keeping the
bidirectional-backlink invariant (principle #4). Print the new Issue URL;
idempotent (Step 4). Reuses `gh_discussion.sh` with [[gh-issue:discussion-create]].

## Options

Arguments (`<discussion-number>`, `[remote]`, the four `--no-*` skip flags,
`--force-category`, `-h`/`--help`/`help`) →
[`references/options.md`](references/options.md).

## Step 1: Detect Repo Context

Record `START_TS=$(date +%s)` for elapsed-time reporting. Parse args, confirm
a git repo, and bind `TARGET_REPO` **and** `TARGET_HOST` from the chosen
remote's URL, then `export GH_HOST="$TARGET_HOST"` — substeps in
[`references/repo-resolution.md`](references/repo-resolution.md). Every `gh`
call below runs as `GH_HOST="$TARGET_HOST" gh ... --repo "$TARGET_REPO"`
(dEitY719/dotfiles#1403 / dEitY719/dotfiles#1407). No silent `origin` fallback on a missing remote.

## Step 2: Fetch the Discussion

Source `shell-common/functions/gh_discussion.sh` and call
`_gh_discussion_fetch "$_owner" "$_repo" "$N"`. Read with `jq`: `.id` (node
ID for comment/close/lock), `.number`, `.title`, `.body`, `.url`,
`.category`, `.closed`, `.locked`. Fetch failure -> abort with stderr.

## Step 3: Category Guard

If `.category != "Ideas"` and `--force-category` is not set, refuse with
the message in [`references/error-cases.md`](references/error-cases.md),
exit 1, and skip Steps 4-9. Principle #2 ("결정되면 즉시 convert") targets
only the Ideas bucket; other categories have different lifecycles and must
not be silently coerced into the tracker.

## Step 4: Idempotency Check (BEFORE any mutation)

Search for an Issue whose body already contains the backlink marker
`Originated from discussion #${N}`. The full `gh issue list` command and the load-bearing `// empty` rationale
live in [`references/convert-cmd.md`](references/convert-cmd.md) Step 4. On a match, print
`[OK] Discussion #<N> already converted to <url>`, exit 0 (NF-1).

## Step 5: Create the Issue

Build the backlink + verbatim Discussion body and `gh issue create`,
capturing `<M>` — detail in
[`references/create-issue.md`](references/create-issue.md).

## Steps 6-8: Post-Create Mutations

Board sync (Step 6), backlink comment (Step 7), close + lock (Step 8) —
all best-effort, all after the Issue exists. Detail and skip-flag logic in
[`references/post-create-mutations.md`](references/post-create-mutations.md).

## Step 9: Report

Print the `[OK]` line + `steps:` summary + `Next:` hint per
[`references/report-template.md`](references/report-template.md). On failure,
name the failing step and quote the first helper stderr line.

## Constraints

Operating invariants (always `--repo`, fail on missing remote, Ideas-only
guard, best-effort post-create mutations, idempotency) →
[`references/constraints.md`](references/constraints.md).

`gh-issue:discussion-create` — the authoring half of the same lifecycle: it opens the
pre-decision RFC, this skill promotes the decided one into the tracker.
