# gh-issue:proceed — Directive Issue → Execution

Read a directive issue (work-order body embedding an executable protocol) and proceed
end-to-end WITHOUT human intervention: validate the schema, execute each step per the
body's `decision_rules`, apply the authorized write actions (commit / PR / comment /
close / file follow-up). Same shell as `/gh-issue:implement` minus superpowers
detection and mode dispatch — a directive issue is pre-designed, so mode is always
`direct`. SSOT: `docs/feature/gh-issue-proceed-skill/design.md`. On each step's success
emit `printf '[step:gh-issue-proceed/<id>] OK\n'` (`fetch-issue`, `schema-valid`,
`execute`, `report`).

## Help

If arg #1 is `-h`, `--help`, or `help`, output `references/help.md`
verbatim, then stop. No API calls.

## Step 1: Parse Args + Resolve Repo

Record `START_TS=$(date +%s)` immediately (elapsed-time for Step 4).
Positional args: `<issue-number> [remote]` — no `mode` arg; always `direct`.

- `issue-number` — required, positive integer.
- `remote` — default `origin`. Bind `TARGET_REPO` **and** `TARGET_HOST` from
  that one remote URL per `references/repo-resolution.md`, then
  `export GH_HOST="$TARGET_HOST"` — every `gh` call below runs as
  `GH_HOST="$TARGET_HOST" gh ... --repo "$TARGET_REPO"` (#1403 / #1407).
  Missing remote → `git remote -v` + stop (no silent fallback).

## Step 2: Fetch + Claim + Schema Validation

2.1 **Fetch + Claim** (`fetch-issue` marker) — run the five claim substeps
in `references/claim.md` (fetch → block-label guard → self-assign → board
transition → depends-on). CLOSED-issue refusal precedes schema
(`references/fetch-issue.md`).

2.2 **Schema validation** (`schema-valid` marker) — validate the body
against the strict 8-section schema in `references/protocol-schema.md`. Any
missing / empty / unparseable required section → print the §3.4 failure
block and STOP — **no comment on the issue** (schema failure is caller-side).

2.3 **Precondition class** — classify per `references/preconditions.md`
(read-only / mutation-required / mixed / verify-only); log it.
`mutation-required` on the default branch or a dirty tree → STOP (hint there).

## Step 3: Execute Protocol

Full sequence in `references/step3-sequence.md` (with
`references/execution-flow.md` + `references/safety-gates.md`). Four stages;
every STOP / fail-closed / default-deny trigger below is binding:

1. **Pre-flight** (Layer 3): branch / secret-shaped files / `gh auth status`
   / dry-run §preconditions. Any failure → STOP.
2. **Parse** `execution_protocol`. Unknown verb in `decision_rules` →
   fail-closed at parse time.
3. **Step loop** — `TaskCreate` → execute under Layer-1 prohibitions +
   Layer-4 monitors → classify vs `decision_rules` (fail-closed on unknown
   class) → apply mapped verb → `TaskUpdate`. Conditional permissions (bulk
   / force-with-lease / cross-repo / net) **default-deny** — only with the
   matching §safety `allow:` token.
4. **Reconcile** `done_criteria`: all matched + no abort → `close_issue:
   <self>` + comment; else keep open `N/M criteria met`. Then emit `execute`.

## Step 4: Report

Print the audit report per `references/report-format.md` (per-step table, write-action audit, done-criteria
reconciliation, outcome), then append the ai-metrics line defined there. Compute
`ELAPSED=$(( ($(date +%s) - START_TS) / 60 ))` before printing; honor `GH_DISABLE_AI_METRICS=1`. Emit `report`.

## Constraints

Gate rules are absolute; see `references/safety-gates.md` for full layers:

- **Never** force-push the default branch, leak a secret to GitHub output, mutate another worktree, or `gh pr merge` — Layer-1, body cannot override.
- **Never** invent a result class or action verb — fail-closed vs `decision_rules` and the fixed verb registry.
- **Never** apply a conditional permission (bulk / force-with-lease / cross-repo / net) without its §safety `allow:` token.
- **Never** run `mutation-required` on the default branch or a dirty tree.
- **Never** comment on schema-validation failure (caller-side).
- Mode is always `direct`; no plan / brainstorming dispatch.

`gh-issue:implement` — sibling in the same slot: that one edits files to satisfy a
code-change issue, this one executes the protocol a directive issue carries.
