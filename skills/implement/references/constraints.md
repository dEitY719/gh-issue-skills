# gh-issue:implement — Hard Constraints

These are deliberate boundaries. Do not violate them even when the user
asks "just this once" — composition skills (`gh-flow:issue`) exist for
the cases where these limits are inconvenient.

## Never call `gh` without an explicit host + repo (dEitY719/dotfiles#1403)

Every `gh` invocation is `GH_HOST="$TARGET_HOST" gh ... --repo "$TARGET_REPO"`,
with both values read from the one remote URL Step 1 resolved
(`references/repo-resolution.md`). Without `--repo`, `gh` follows its own
`gh repo set-default` rather than git's `origin`; a user authenticated to both
github.com and a GHES instance then gets a query against the wrong server that
**succeeds silently** — an OPEN issue comes back as "doesn't exist", and a
write (self-assign, board move) lands on a stranger's issue #N.

Never work around a surprising `gh` result by retrying, by dropping `--repo`,
or by switching remotes. Verify the host first.

## Never create commits or PRs

This skill stops at "files edited, tests run". Commits and PRs are
separate skills (`gh-pr:commit`, `gh-pr:create`) so the user can:

- Inspect the diff before committing.
- Squash multiple implementation attempts into one commit.
- Choose commit message style per repo.

If you find yourself running `git commit` here, stop. Print the final
report and exit.

## Never create a git worktree

The `gwt` helper / `session:worktree-spawn` skill is the entry point for
worktree creation. By the time this skill runs, the user is already in
the right directory. Creating a worktree from inside this skill would
nest worktrees and confuse the cleanup flow.

## Never run on the default branch

Implementing directly on `main` / `master` corrupts the base for every
other in-flight feature branch. Step 1 enforces this — if the check
ever fires, do not bypass it.

## Never dismiss pre-existing test failures

The pre-edit baseline in `implementation-flow.md` distinguishes
PRE-EXISTING (failing before this skill ran) from CAUSED (introduced
by this skill's edits). Fixing pre-existing failures expands scope
silently and pollutes the diff. Report them in the final output and
let the human decide whether to fix them in a separate change.

**Applies to every path, including the direct-mode TDD path.**
`superpowers:test-driven-development` → "Verify GREEN" says "Other
tests fail? Fix now." — that is scoped to failures NOT in
`pre_existing_failures`. This constraint outranks the TDD skill's
blanket wording; the exception is documented in
`references/superpowers-detection.md` → "Pre-existing exception". Never
edit the TDD skill itself to encode it.

## Never retry the test-failure loop more than 3 times

Scope: the **fallback path** (superpowers absent), which is the only
path with a mechanical retry counter. Three attempts is enough for the
model to either converge or admit defeat. Beyond that, the failure
pattern is usually not a mechanical-fix problem — handing back to the
human is faster than burning more tokens on a wrong hypothesis.

The TDD path has no counter and must not grow one: red-green-refactor
already bounds each step. It stops on judgment (same failure repeating,
fix breaking a green test, unexplained failure) — do not invent a
substitute attempt budget.

## Never require superpowers to work

Direct mode is always available. The plugin gates `plan` and
`brainstorming` modes, and picks the TDD path over the built-in
fallback path inside `direct` — but it never gates `direct` itself.
The fallback path stays a **complete** implementation flow: baseline
capture, edits, tests, bounded failure loop, full report. It is a
different route to the same finish line, not a degraded one.
Hard-requiring the plugin would make the skill fail on machines
without it — defeating the purpose of a graceful fallback.
