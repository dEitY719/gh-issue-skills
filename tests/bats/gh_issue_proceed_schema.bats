# Verify the strict 8-section schema validator documented in
#   skills/proceed/references/protocol-schema.md
# by running the shipped lib/validate-protocol.sh
# (fixture: fixtures/gh_issue_proceed_schema.sh). The helper prints nothing
# on success, so PASS variants assert empty output.
#
# Five variants from design §8 / acceptance criteria:
#   1. all-OK     → PASS
#   2. missing    → FAIL (Missing required sections)
#   3. empty      → FAIL (Empty required sections)
#   4. H3-nested  → PASS (validator matches H2-H3)
#   5. KO-aliases → PASS (Korean heading aliases)

## Goal
Verify the CLI end-to-end so that every documented command returns success.

## Preconditions
The repo is cloned and the binary is built; network access to the API is available.

## Execution Protocol
1. Run `app --help` and confirm a usage block prints without any error here.
2. Run `app list 1 10` and confirm ten rows of output appear correctly here.

## Decision Rules
- PASS: continue to the next step in the protocol as normal without action.
- FAIL-CLI: file_issue: cli-bug and then continue with the remaining steps.

## Deliverables
A short verification report plus one filed follow-up issue per failing command.

## Done Criteria
- [ ] every documented command was executed at least once during the run
- [ ] a report comment summarizing pass and fail counts was posted

## Out of Scope
Performance benchmarking and load testing are explicitly not part of this task.

## Safety
Read-only verification only. Abort on any destructive command encountered here.

## 목표
모든 문서화된 명령을 직접 실행하여 정상적으로 종료되는지 처음부터 끝까지 빠짐없이 검증한다 end to end verification.

## 사전 조건
저장소가 클론되어 있고 바이너리가 빌드되어 있으며 API 네트워크 접근이 가능하다 here.

## 실행 절차
1. `app --help` 를 실행하여 사용법 블록이 오류 없이 출력되는지 확인한다 step one.
2. `app list 1 10` 를 실행하여 열 개의 행이 정상 출력되는지 확인한다 step two.

## 결정 규칙
- PASS: 다음 단계로 계속 진행한다 continue without any extra action taken here.

## 산출물
짧은 검증 리포트와 실패한 명령마다 하나씩 등록한 후속 이슈를 제출한다 deliverable.

## 종료 조건
- [ ] 모든 문서화된 명령이 최소 한 번 이상 실행되었다 executed at least once

## 범위 밖
성능 벤치마크와 부하 테스트 그리고 보안 감사는 이 작업의 범위에 전혀 포함되지 않는다 strictly out of scope here.

## 안전 규칙
읽기 전용 검증만 수행한다. 파괴적 명령을 만나면 즉시 중단한다 abort on danger.
